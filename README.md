# Sudoku-Game
A sudoku to workout your brain

Life is like a sudoku, if you don't know why you have choosen that number, at the end it will be a mess, you can erase in sudoku but not in real life!

And for all the coders out there this is a sudoku solver which uses the backtracking algorithm. I have used PyGame for the GUI.

# How To Play
Click a box and hit the number on your keybaord to temporarily pencil in the number. To confirm that value click on the box and press the ENTER key on that box. To delete a penciled in number you can click on the box and hit the DEL button on your keyboard. And to solve the entire puzzle just hit the SPACE BAR and watch the puzzle solve itself!
